            <p>
                There are many things that can make or break a video game, but I have made a 
                list of items that I feel contribute to a game being successful.
            </p>

        <section id="characters">
            <h2>Character Development</h2>
            <p>
                Games that provide the player with a character they can develop are more successful.
                When a character is developed over time, the player becomes more <em>invested</em> in
                that character, and by extension, the game.   This discourages the player from quitting
                and starting over fresh, and helps weather the more difficult or tedious parts.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="builds">
            <h2>Tech / Skill Templates</h2>
            <p>
                Tech / Skill templates, or &quot;<em>builds</em>&quot; give the player the ability to
                <i>choose</i> a progression path in the game.  When a player is successful in a game, 
                they attribute the success to the build  unique choices the player made in the game, not
                the game mechanics or balancing.  Players will share their builds with other players,
                and seek to try out new build designs.  In some cases, trying the various builds 
                becomes a game within itself.  When the game is altered based on the techs / skill choices
                of the player, then game's <em>replayability</em> is greatly increased.

        <section id="exploration">
            <h2>Open World Exploration</h2>
            <p>
                Allow the player to explore the world the game has to offer, instead of locking the
                player into specific zones.  Open world exploration lets the player &quot;discover&quot;
                the game instead of being fed it.  It allows the player to progress at their own pace and
                choose their own progression paths.
            </p>

        <section id="simplicity">
            <h2>Simplicity</h2>
            <p>
                Simple controls that are easy to understand and master are essential to any successful game.
                Simple camera modes that do not get in the player's way make the game successful.
                A simple backstory.  History has shown us that the simpler games go on to be the greatest.
                This does not mean that games cannot be complex, but they should be complex in their content,
                which the player consumes, not complex to use.

        <section id="rewards">
            <h2>Rewards</h2>
            <p>
                Keep that dopamine flowing!   Gold coins. Flashing lights.  Happy audible chimes.  Words
                of encouragement.  Read any modern gamification article and you will see that rewards
                are key to any successful game.  It keeps the player hooked, keeps the player happy, and
                encourages the player to play more.

        <section id="quests">
            <h2>Quests / Missions</h2>
            <p>
                There is nothing worse than a great game that you can't figure out what to do.  Quests
                and missions are integral to a game for two reasons.
                <ol>
                    <li>They keep the player busy with new challengs and things to do</li>
                    <li>They direct the player through the game.  This can include ensuring the 
                        player knows how to play (a tutorial), or it can include the game objectives.
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <section id="learning">
            <h2>Learning / Skill</h2>
            <p>
                Humans love to learn and acquire new skills.   Games can achieve this in one of two ways.
                The first is by educating them and the second is by making the game a skill.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Like any good book, the author should spend a fair bit of time researching the material
                in their game in order to ensure that their game achieves <attr>suspension of disbelief<attr>.
                You want the player to &quot;just go with it&quot; and not pause gameplay and cry foul.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other method of invoking learning is to make the game itself a skill.   When the game
                itself is a skill, it means that the more you play - the better you get, regardless of
                your character.  In <attr>Super Mario Bros</attr> the player's <i>skill</i> at platforming
                made them a better player.  That skill takes practice to learn and master.  Much the same
                as the character development point - the player becomes more invested in a game where skills
                matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Combine both Learning and Skill building for a phenomenal game.  Take <attr>Kerbal Space
                Program</attr> as an example.  Anyone can start the game and launch rockets into space.
                Those that play the game again and again begin to develop a skill at launching vessels
                efficiently.   But the game's physics is based on real world rocket science.  Therefore a
                player that learns the rocket science will get more from the game and become a better player.

        <section id="collect">
            <h2>Collecting and Accessories</h2>
            <p>
                Humans love to collect.  It keeps the game fresh, lets them use the creative parts of their brains
                and gives them something to impress their friends with.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been common place in games for digital items to be sold for real cash.  This is a
                great revenue stream for game developers, but it also keeps the player playing.  Why?
                On the one hand, the player has invested a lot into the game.  On the other hand, the game
                is changing with each accessory.

            <h2>Fun</h2>
            <p>
                Humans love to laugh and have fun.   Games that are fun or include elements of comedy
                will always be more successful.
            </p>

        <section id="brands">
            <h2>Brands</h2>
            <p>
                Using a familiar brand with your video game establishes a familiarity with the subject
                matter going in, and certain prebuilt enthusiasm toward the game.
