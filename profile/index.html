        I put together this profile to share a bit about myself.

        <h3>Q & A</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Where you are from?</dt>
            <dd>
              I am currently residing in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada.  Sherwood Park is a suburb in the greater Edmonton area.
            </dd>
          <dt>Do you have a family?</dt>
            <dd>
              I do!  I have been married since 2001, and I have three teenage sons.
            </dd>
          <dt>Why are you on GitHub?</dt>
            <dd>
              I have been a member of GitHub for many years, but currently I have decided to use GitHub for the
              <cite>GitHub Pages</cite> feature. I am currently trying to teach my boys how to program.  I needed
              a free hosting website for them to use to upload their assignments to, and when I discovered <em>GitHub
              Pages</em> I thought to myself <i>This is great.  I can teach them to use Git simultaneously</i>.
            </dd>
          <dt>What do you do for a living?</dt>
            <dd>
              Officially, right now, I am unemployed.  Unofficially, I have a non-profitable business in which I provide 
              a myriad of computer services ranging from system administration to Access database development to building websites.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Prior to being unemployed I worked in the construction sector providing <cite>Oracle</cite> database support 
              for an inhouse application that managed construction personnel and facilitated payroll.
            </dd>
          <dt>What are your Hobbies / Interests?</dt>
            <dd>
              I have always loved two things as long as I can remember.  Computer games and programming.  The two have not
              yet been combined, but I am hopeful.  Someday ...
