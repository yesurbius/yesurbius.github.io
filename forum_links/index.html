    <h1>Scotland ...</h1>
    <h2>... soon to be owned by Kildare or England ...</h2>
    <p>
      I have 174 hours logged with EU4 and I still feel like I don't
      even know how to play.   I have familiarized myself a bit more
      with combat, I *think* I understand development and trade, but
      the AI seems to fly right by me everytime.  I have yet to finish
      a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this, I thought I would post the screenshots of my
      current game, and get some feedback from the reddit community.
    </p>
    <h4>Here is the map:</h4>

    <p>
      Previous times when I played Scotland, I would either get taken
      over by England or by Ireland.  So this game, I left England alone
      and immediately made a military incursion into Ireland.   
    </p>
    <p>
      I allied with Kildare because they were expansionists.  I took over  
      Ulaidh and Deas-Mhumhain and then sold them to Kildare.  My strategy
      here was to give Kildare a boost so it would take over Ireland.
      Kildare did exactly that.  It took over all but two provinces.
      One (Pale) was owned by England, and the other Sligeach, was in
      a personal union (and allied) with England.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most of the game I was sitting at +200 relationship with 
      Kildare.  It had dropped to about +150 .. then all of a sudden
      went to -100 or something.  I was notified that our alliance was
      broke, and that Kildare received a conquest Causius Beli on me 
      after laying claim to pretty much all my Scottish lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding myself without any allies I quickly started building up
      relations with the blue blob and was able to finally establish
      an alliance with the French.  I have no interest in being allied
      with the French - but I wanted a deterrent from English / Kildaire
      aggression.
    </p>
    <h4>So what's the problem?</h4>
    <p>
      The problem is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kildare somehow managed to surpass me in both development and           military strength (and tech). </li>
      <li>I have two armies consisting of 4 units each (2 infantry, 
          1 horse, 1 cannon).  </li>
      <li>I am only making +1.04 gold per turn, and
          I don't think I can support a bigger army.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>So my question is ...</h3>
    <p>
      What am I doing wrong?
